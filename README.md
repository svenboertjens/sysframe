# Sysframe

A framework designed for providing tools to develop system services with.


## Introduction

This is a custom framework that provides the tools used by the various system services made by me. This includes modules such as for managing shared memory and other IPC operations, and serialization for converting values to bytes to store them in said shared memory.


## Current modules

This framework currently consists of the following modules:

- `pybytes`
- `membridge`

Explanations on how to use these modules are found in module-specific README files, such as `README_pybytes.md` for the `pybytes` module.
For code-specific documentation, there aren't special README's for that. I've tried to explain each piece of code well enough using in-code comments.


## Notes

These libraries are used by system services developed by me,
